## **About**

This game was built using a combination of Javascript, HTML and CSS, and was a way to put DOM manipulation skills in practice. The purpose is to match all of the cards to its corresponding pair. Once the player has found all of the pairs, a pop up will show onscreen with a congratulatory message. This game also incorprates a reset button, that will randomly shuffle the cards so that they are not in the same order each time.
